      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dawn wakes us up in ways that are different. I wonder what kind of dawn awaits me tomorrow. Will I face new waves of darkness, rain, and the pitter-patter of its drops letting me know of its existence? Or will I be awakened to the warmth of the lovely Yellow Face, inanimate as she is?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I look for hope when there has been none. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see it if I am surrounded by clouds of darkness and despair. But hope in itself irrigates the land we&amp;rsquo;re upon. Like roots beneath the soil, it works quietly, unseen, steady. It matters not how many fogs there are about, as long as the ground is steady.  It may, for a while, blind us, but we can always keep walking – yes, walk - but with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s beautiful,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; she muttered as she looked at the girl on tv walked down the aisle during the pageant. The pregnant woman watching the tv stared in awe as she favored the girl whom she&amp;rsquo;s watching right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wonder what&amp;rsquo;s her name,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; the candidate moved forward and stepped onto the platform to formally introduce herself. She was beautiful and her smile lit up her pretty face as her eyes gleamed a confident glow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
