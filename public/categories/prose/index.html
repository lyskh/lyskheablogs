Gentle Entry Into the Ordinary Going to school meant doing mundane things: wearing the same old uniforms that I&rsquo;ve used for years, waking up at the same time (inconsistently, however) whenever the alarm clock rings, and undergoing the same old routine I&rsquo;m used to.
Whenever these things happened, I mostly just cruised through on autopilot, not minding each step as long as I could get to the next. After all, the main goal was to go to school.
It wasn&rsquo;t until life disrupted my schedule and routine that I realized I longed for the comfort of the mundanity of the rituals I did every morning.
Waking up, turning my alarm off, bathing, eating, and brushing were all things I did during those days. This routine I had, I mostly took for granted. When life forces you to shift from the repetition of your habits, you may feel the pressure—and only then do you appreciate it. Indeed, it can be growth. However, there is a certain comfort and stability that allow you to rest when things are predictable.
It is not bad to undergo periods of change in life that leave us pressured and force us to adjust, whether drastically or minimally. Humans are made to evolve, and sometimes that looks like change and novelty.
II. The Brain’s Love Language Is Predictability But humans are also made for comfort. Pressure changes us, and it can—and should—always be for the better, but prolonged periods under stress are never healthy. We cannot grow under constant tension; we need recovery.
Rest allows humans to adapt with resilience and is crucial for emotional regulation. This is why meditation and self-care routines are rising in response to the hustle-and-grind culture. Predictable rest allows adaptability and stability without inhibiting innovation and learning.
With how unpredictable the world is becoming, choosing predictability is not regression. It is regulation.
III. Why Repetition Feels Like Safety (Not Boredom) Habits have always been a topic among scholars and ordinary people alike. According to what we are taught, growth comes from constant change.
Being ambitious and always seeking the next milestone is good, but you can only handle so much change. You need to allow your body and mind to take a step back and cherish what you have been through, learning the lessons along the way—whether the milestone you&rsquo;ve achieved is small or big.
Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just a hypervigilant machine, gathering more and more experiences without actually experiencing them fully, missing the lessons they were made to teach.
Repetition has always been seen as mundane, boring, ordinary—almost unworthy for those chasing greatness. Overreliance on habits can lead to rigidity, especially when breaking them feels threatening.
But that&rsquo;s not what I want to focus on today.
The truth is, we can never fully grow and achieve the greatness we want until we allow ourselves to feel pressure and simultaneously embrace the comfort of familiarity and rest. Pressure and pause, together, allow adaptability, innovation, sustained creativity, and emotional maturity.
IV. Comfort Is Not Laziness: A Cultural Rebuttal Productivity culture frames comfort and predictability as weakness. Yet, research shows that predictability—whether in routine or schedule—actually enhances our capacity to handle growth. When routines become comfort zones, they allow us to return, rest, meditate, and reflect on what we’ve learned.
Rest is not a sign that growth doesn’t matter; on the contrary, it is essential. Recovery during ordinary, mundane acts may actually help us become more grounded, stable, and emotionally regulated.
There is a difference between escaping into predictability and leaning into ordinary routines for recovery without compromising growth.
That could look like journaling, meditating on lessons learned, taking care of your body, or regulating emotionally. Taking a pause ensures you are actually experiencing life, rather than operating on autopilot.
When we embrace these moments, creativity follows. Each person can generate unique meaning from their hardships, regardless of how common they might be. Learning to rest in these crucial times allows space for individuality, perspective, and the value one can offer. Humans naturally value what they can contribute—it gives a sense of impact and purpose, proving that all experiences are not for nothing.
The Quiet Power of the Ordinary Ever since my schedule and life routine were disrupted, I have longed for those simple routines I had before. They allowed me to be calm and plan my day. Afterwards, I would reflect on what I experienced.
It is harder now, but I never lost hope. Recovery can be recreated intentionally. Growth and rest can coexist, and it may look different for everyone. It can be as simple as journaling, praying, or sipping your favorite drink.
In a world of increasing unpredictability, choosing familiarity and rest is a quiet, radical act of self-care—and, in fact, growth.

The importance of choosing to be grateful can be seen in the resulting joy it entails. One sip of coffee with gratitude can greatly align our perspectives and uplift our moods even when things in our life turn sour.
Reminders like this greatly benefit us who are most prone to being forgetful. Being able to be grateful even when things are painful is not a discipline that is easy to incorporate - it has to be wrought by grace. Adopting this mindset also increases the risk of toxic positivity in us if we do it by ourselves, which will be damaging for us in the long run.
My purpose in writing this is not to share a mindset that celebrates masochism and pain in an unhealthy way. No, that is not what I want for me nor for you. I hope to inspire other people that even if life will not turn out for the better as we hope because sometimes it just gets worse, we would be grounded enough to not base our happiness on circumstances, people, nor on things which can all lead to disappointments - but to rest our hope on hope.
Hoping Against Hope How can you hope when things are so dark and despairing, that so much of it would make you hopeless?
In times of painful despair, there is nothing more paralyzing than hoping. When children and loved ones die, dreams crushed, and reality seems to remind you of the absences of the things lost or not given to us, it is painful to bear the longings of the dashed pieces in our lives. When people betray us, and dreams have not yet matured - or never will be - though we longed or waited for years long, it can be crushing for us when these hopes are not given or denied, and yet to tell ourselves to continue hoping.
Come to think of it, without hope, we lessen the risk of despair. How many of us have said to ourselves, &ldquo;If only I didn&rsquo;t trust so much, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been betrayed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;If only I hadn&rsquo;t kept my hopes up, I would not have been disappointed.&rdquo;
Both of these scenarios can be linked to hoping - we trusted because we hoped they were trustworthy, we expected things because we hoped our dreams would soon be realized.
So what do I mean about hoping on hope?
In Mere Christianity, Lewis writes:
Hope is one of the Theological virtues. This means that a continual looking forward to the eternal world is not (as some modern people think) a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do.
Hope in the Christian life is not something we give to ourselves, nor of someone else. It is given by God Himself, not in a wishy-washy way where we&rsquo;d hear His voice, but through His means of grace in our lives. It has been long said that hope is &ldquo;a desire or feeling&rdquo;, but in biblical terms not only is it a feeling of confident expectation, rather, it is also an action.
John Piper also has some words in this article about hope:
If I am put down, I look to the emotional reservoir of hope for the strength to return good for evil. Without hope, I have no power to absorb the wrong and walk in love, and I sink into self-pity or self-justification.
If I experience a setback in my planning — I get sick, or things don’t go the way I’d hoped in the board meeting, for example — I look to the emotional reservoir of hope for the strength to keep going and not give up.
If I face a temptation to be dishonest, to steal, to lie, or to lust, I look to the emotional reservoir of hope for the strength to hold fast to the way of righteousness, and deny myself some brief, unsatisfying pleasure.
Hoping is akin to looking, not to our circumstances but to God who is the Giver of Hope, especially to His promise.
Gratitude and Hope What does hope have to do with gratitude? I have implied that hoping is akin to looking, well, gratitude can be a good place to start.
Hope looks to the future, and gratitude contents itself in the present.
When storms in life arise and there is nothing to hold onto and when all we can see are loss and despair, gratitude creates a window of relief: a sigh, a breath of fresh air and with it a steady ground for the soil - hope - where we could plant our seeds anew, and to trust that whatever may happen in the future we would be able to find joy in the midst of chaos by looking not to our circumstances but to God and His promises.
We ground ourselves steady in His time-tested words, and hold Him to His word as we trust that He will accomplish what He has started in us, through us, for His glory and our good.
Gratitude creates in us an attitude of looking to things given rather than things denied or lost. It helps us appreciate what we have now, and enables us to look forward. While hope may seem painful sometimes, and not hoping for anything may act as a shield from pain and disappointments, the life you&rsquo;ll be living is a life left un-lived. But we don&rsquo;t need to shy away from the pain and risk of disappointments, we have been given grace, strength, and tools to enable us to hope even in this world of suffering and sin.
While hope is entirely another topic I probably should write about, we shall stick with gratitude for now, and I hope to be given time and wisdom to be able to write about it in the future.
Gratitude is a discipline, a skill that must be daily practiced and must not be relied on feelings - for we know how fickle we are as humans.

&ldquo;I just want this done.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why does this keep on happening to me?&rdquo;
All of us have said these lines once or twice—or even multiple times a day. We are not immune to the loads of tasks that we might tackle under short notice. Oftentimes, we find it hard to have peace when small inconveniences happen. Things don&rsquo;t go as we planned, work continues to pile up, quizzes and school assignments seem never-ending.
On top of that, we have burdens that need catering to and are unfinished whether emotionally or mentally. We face these challenges almost always simultaneously, and all of a sudden, we find ourselves complaining. But ask yourself, has it always been helpful? Does it not rob us of peace and the strength for a task that has not even started?
&ldquo;Why is it so hard?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why does it have to be me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;This again?&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is unfair.&rdquo;
or even deeper, something like this:
&ldquo;Why am I like this?&rdquo;
It is not wrong to strive to excel in everything. I mean, we often complain because we see that our goals are not aligned with our reality—we find it frustrating when things don&rsquo;t behave the way they must. And I am not talking about unplanned inconveniences alone, but also the frustrations that we have in ourselves.
Think back—how often have you caught yourself complaining?
In a fast-paced world where everything has to be instantaneous, we can get short-sighted by our limitations as we fall into two things: underestimating or overestimating ourselves.
When a schoolwork comes up and it is not something we have done previously, it is easy to run ahead of ourselves and say our frustrations just because we feel intimidated by the newness of the challenge. We are not used to challenging ourselves and our existing beliefs, systems, or routines, that we find it easier to complain first before getting to embracing the challenges presented before us.
By doing this, we underestimate ourselves. We sell ourselves short and we look not beyond to what we could accomplish or what could serve to glorify God and uplift others. We don&rsquo;t like to be inconvenienced, and we limit ourselves to stay in what is comfortable at the cost of our growth. We choose what is easy and comfortable even if it meant stagnation.
I am not saying that it is wrong to feel tired or sigh a little bit when we get new work or jobs to do. I am referring to the kind of complaints that is usually a default mode in us. We haven&rsquo;t even tackled the project yet, but it already seemed insurmountable. I am not immune to this—I am this too.
When Complaints Become a Cycle Now, there are instances where we accept more jobs than we can handle. We never know where our limitations lie, and when we make work that does not produce the qualities we intended, we get frustrated—and we complain. Again.
Again, it is never wrong to complain about outputs that don&rsquo;t pass our standards. The desire to produce the highest quality within our capacities is built into all of us. But it is also never wrong to be honest with ourselves and say that, &ldquo;This is something that is beyond my capacity.&rdquo;
I am not referring to the kinds of complaints that have persevered under duress and hard circumstances. There are times that there is nothing we can do but to cry out, and it is a very valid and human response. That is not what I am talking about here.
It is not wrong to feel tired, but it is not right to view things in a complaint mode consistently.
When hard times come, it is easier to focus on the trial and complain.
But what if I tell you there is another way to respond?
My Turning Point There was a time when I was, as I could say, hard-pressed against all sides. Relationally, I was not doing good. Various conflicts arose, and the challenges in my relationships were really bad. I found it frustrating back then that alongside these relational problems (in almost all aspects of my life), I had troubles with my studies and work. Spiritually, I wasn&rsquo;t doing good either.
Looking back, it really was just a hard place—a wasteland. It&rsquo;s not even the wilderness, but a place where hopes got crushed, and strengths got pushed farther than they were able. And when I tried to look at my circumstances, I had nothing to see but darkness and brokenness all over.
I praise God for giving me grace. I believe that He really met me where I was at that time. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Him, I&rsquo;d never know where I&rsquo;d be. I probably would not have made it to the other side.
So what I did was, since I felt that I had no other choice but to sigh, complain—a LOT—cry out and say that this was a place I never wanted to be nor would I ever want to stay in any longer.
My health was failing, my relationships deteriorating, and on top of that, I had to show up to school and work bringing in the best of my capabilities to sustain the qualities they asked of me.
My cries also sometimes felt that they were not heard. It was a situation where complaining was by far the easiest thing to do. So I did it at every chance I got.
It also, however, made me stuck in that place longer than it would have been had I allowed myself to be humbled by His grace and accept everything with a grateful and submissive heart.
So there I was, still complaining why I was the way I was, and also complaining about my circumstances. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t working—it was just easier.
I got to a point where I couldn&rsquo;t see any hope or future that I wanted as long as I stayed in that mode. This is what I meant when I said that if it was not for His grace, I would be far worse today.
One night, I took a long, hard look at myself and saw that I was not only hurting my relationship with the Lord but also those whom I had promised to protect and love. I knew that by going in this direction, it would give way to a path where I would forever regret. It was a glimpse of what my life would be as I pictured it, that would come as a result of the path I was walking on. Until now, I couldn&rsquo;t erase that image. I hated the picture.
Something inside me snapped. I repented and asked for forgiveness, and by that, I finally got more careful.
A New Perspective Along the way, I still found it difficult to cope with my situations since they still were not the way I wanted. Complaining was still one of the main things I did, but I also knew it would pave the way to the path I dreaded.
I had no choice, but by grace, I felt forced to look at things gratefully. My eyes were finally opened by grace to view the world with childlike wonder. Heck, even sunlight makes me giggle with joy now. I practiced gratitude daily then. I noticed that though it never changed my situations, I was more attuned to my walk, joy in my relationship with Christ (the most important thing for me), and I was enabled—by grace, because all is grace (grasya lang gid tanan! IYKYK)—to view things, no matter how small, with gratefulness and joy.
It still came as a challenge for me, since sometimes the situations got worse, but now I have learned that joy and gratitude are both choices I can make no matter how bad things get.
The good in my life was Christ. I will forever be foremostly grateful for His salvation and my relationship with Him. He chose me when I would never have chosen myself.
Practicing gratitude was a real life-changer. It was the means that God used to make me enjoy the things He has bought at the cost of His blood. It made me less entitled, and more focused on the now than what or how I&rsquo;ve wanted things to be. Gratitude brought about by grace is something that I realized, not a small thing. Instead of looking to the missing things, gratitude turns our attention to what has already been given to us. It trusts that in the face of hardships, God is working something behind the mess.
Gratitude and joy go hand-in-hand. If you can find things to be grateful for in everything no matter where you are in life, it&rsquo;s easier to focus more on garnering joy even in the presence of pain. &ldquo;Joy and pain can coexist,&rdquo; indeed. Joy is never the absence of pain, it is what helps us get through it. Christians can have a joy that can be made even in the midst of chaos.
Christ has made this all possible for me—and you.
Joy Is a Choice That is why I always want to encourage people to learn this skill, because truthfully, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to learn the hard way as I did—just because I chose to complain instead of looking to the good.
I would like to exhort you, my dearest brethren: gratitude plays an important key in our witnessing to the world.
Will you choose joy today, or will you choose to stay in the cycle of complaints?

I wonder what kind of dawn awaits me tomorrow. Will I face new waves of darkness, rain, and the pitter-patter of its drops letting me know of its existence? Or will I be awakened to the warmth of the lovely Yellow Face, inanimate as she is?
Sometimes, I look for hope when there has been none. It&rsquo;s hard to see it if I am surrounded by clouds of darkness and despair. But hope in itself irrigates the land we&rsquo;re upon. Like roots beneath the soil, it works quietly, unseen, steady. It matters not how many fogs there are about, as long as the ground is steady. It may, for a while, blind us, but we can always keep walking – yes, walk - but with purpose.
Even if it&rsquo;s unclear, as long as you&rsquo;re moving, you&rsquo;re living. Life goes on, and we aren&rsquo;t the better for it if we remain stuck in the clouds.
Who knows whether we&rsquo;ll gain an entrance to the paths of the sun?

The pregnant woman watching the tv stared in awe as she favored the girl whom she&rsquo;s watching right now.

&ldquo;Good evening, I am Allysa Kaye,&rdquo; the pregnant woman adored her name as much as she adored her beauty.
&ldquo;Now I know what to name her.&rdquo;
And on a sunny morning, a beautiful infant came into the world.
&ldquo;Her name is Allysa Khae.&rdquo;
And that&rsquo;s how I got my name in this life.
My Name is Allysa, and I Started a Blog Honestly, I have no idea how I ended up here. Writing has always been something I wanted to do, but I never really knew how to start. Then I thought—I&rsquo;m an IT student, so why not practice building static websites while setting up a blog? Before I knew it, I had a fully deployed site, all for free. It’s crazy how true it is that we can accomplish whatever we put our minds to. [That is, God-willing.]
Now that I&rsquo;m here, though, I’m not exactly sure where to begin. At first, this blog was just supposed to be a portfolio, something to impress future clients while I hopped from one job to another. But somewhere along the way, I realized—portfolio or not—I’m sticking with this. I’m going to make the best of it.
I blog to express myself, to put something positive, valuable, and authentic into the world. I want this space to be as real as possible—unfiltered, unapologetic, and entirely me.

People are different and built in their own ways. We have different tastes, outlooks, and opinions on how we want our life. Unfortunately for me, I crave stability over novelty.
I love it when things take their time to grow, I love seeing growth over a long period of time, and even after decadence and failures, and I love it when patience is patient in each of us – what I meant is how patience teaches us to be patient with ourselves, others, and the things or the outcomes in our lives.
There is a special grace in the middle – the mundane, the zero, the grey – a time when flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom when expected, but you kept watering consistently, enduringly, and patiently.
Some things are made to endure by enduring; some of which cannot be achieved without consistent repetition. Character takes time. Love takes time. I think almost all the most beautiful things we want in life must take time. Does this mean those who crave novelty are lesser in their ideals?
No.
For novelty is the desire to innovate what was, a taste for maybe something better, for even stability must not be stable if it worsens. Stability is thus improved and bettered upon, when novelty is used for good without compromising the core truths and stability&rsquo;s non-negotiable 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘶𝘮 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘴.
As a growing young adult, I lean more on the spectrum towards that which is stable. I believe that while we are meant to progress, we are also meant to endure, stabilized enough that we would not be swayed by every new thing, doctrine, or ideals. Humans are complex, life is very nuanced. It&rsquo;s so interesting to live. I praise God.

One can long for peace and quiet. Dream of being drifted away, somewhere far where no one can see me. Drinking a cup of coffee inside a warm, cozy, little house, content to ignore and be ignored. It is a dream of mine, howbeit, as long as we are in this world, darkness will follow. Sorrows will come, and shadows of doubts will often visit.
But there is one place. A place of peace and quiet, where you can remain as you are — loved and accepted.
