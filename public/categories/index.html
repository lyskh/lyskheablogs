    "content": "\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she muttered as she looked at the girl on tv walked down the aisle during the pageant. The pregnant woman watching the tv stared in awe as she favored the girl whom she\u0026rsquo;s watching right now.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder what\u0026rsquo;s her name,\u0026rdquo; the candidate moved forward and stepped onto the platform to formally introduce herself. She was beautiful and her smile lit up her pretty face as her eyes gleamed a confident glow.\n\u0026ldquo;Good evening, I am Allysa Kaye,\u0026rdquo; the pregnant woman adored her name as much as she adored her beauty.\n\u0026ldquo;Now I know what to name her.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd on January 21, 2003, a beautiful infant came into the world.\n\u0026ldquo;Her name is Allysa Khae.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how I got my name in this life.\nMy Name is Allysa, and I Started a Blog Honestly, I have no idea how I ended up here. Writing has always been something I wanted to do, but I never really knew how to start. Then I thought—I\u0026rsquo;m an IT student, so why not practice building static websites while setting up a blog? Before I knew it, I had a fully deployed site, all for free. It’s crazy how true it is that we can accomplish whatever we put our minds to. [That is, God-willing.]\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;m here, though, I’m not exactly sure where to begin. At first, this blog was just supposed to be a portfolio, something to impress future clients while I hopped from one job to another. But somewhere along the way, I realized—portfolio or not—I’m sticking with this. I’m going to make the best of it.\nI blog to express myself, to put something positive, valuable, and authentic into the world. I want this space to be as real as possible—unfiltered, unapologetic, and entirely me.\nWelcome to my first article! It won’t be my last.\n",

    "content": "9:09 PM\nPeople are different and built in their own ways. We have different tastes, outlooks, and opinions on how we want our life. Unfortunately for me, I crave stability over novelty.\nI love it when things take their time to grow, I love seeing growth over a long period of time, and even after decadence and failures, and I love it when patience is patient in each of us – what I meant is how patience teaches us to be patient with ourselves, others, and the things or the outcomes in our lives.\nThere is a special grace in the middle – the mundane, the zero, the grey – a time when flowers didn\u0026rsquo;t bloom when expected, but you kept watering consistently, enduringly, and patiently.\nSome things are made to endure by enduring; some of which cannot be achieved without consistent repetition. Character takes time. Love takes time. I think almost all the most beautiful things we want in life must take time. Does this mean those who crave novelty are lesser in their ideals?\nNo.\nFor novelty is the desire to innovate what was, a taste for maybe something better, for even stability must not be stable if it worsens. Stability is thus improved and bettered upon, when novelty is used for good without compromising the core truths and stability\u0026rsquo;s non-negotiable 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘶𝘮 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘴.\nAs a growing young adult, I lean more on the spectrum towards that which is stable. I believe that while we are meant to progress, we are also meant to endure, stabilized enough that we would not be swayed by every new thing, doctrine, or ideals. Humans are complex, life is very nuanced. It\u0026rsquo;s so interesting to live. I praise God.\n",

Sorrows will come, and shadows of doubts will often visit.\nBut there is one place. A place of peace and quiet, where you can remain as you are — loved and accepted.\n",
