People are different and built in their own ways. We have different tastes, outlooks, and opinions on how we want our life. Unfortunately for me, I crave stability over novelty. 

I love it when things take their time to grow, I love seeing growth over a long period of time, and even after decadence and failures, and I love it when patience is patient in each of us – what I meant is how patience teaches us to be patient with ourselves, others, and the things or the outcomes in our lives. 

There is a special grace in the middle – the mundane, the zero, the grey – a time when flowers didn't bloom when expected, but you kept watering consistently, enduringly, and patiently.

Some things are made to endure by enduring; some of which cannot be achieved without consistent repetition.
character takes time. love takes time. I think almost all the most beautiful things we want in life must take time.
does this mean those who crave novelty are lesser in their ideals?

***No.***

For novelty is the desire to innovate what was, a taste for maybe something better, for even stability must not be stable if it worsens. Stability is thus improved and bettered upon, when novelty is used for good without compromising the core truths and stability's non-negotiable 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘶𝘮 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘴.

As a growing young adult, I lean more on the spectrum towards that which is stable. I believe that while we are meant to progress, we are also meant to endure, stabilized enough that we would not be swayed by every new thing, doctrine, or ideals. Humans are complex, life is very nuanced. It's so interesting to live. I praise God.
