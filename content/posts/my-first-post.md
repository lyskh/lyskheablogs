*"She's beautiful,"* she muttered as she looked at the girl on tv walked down the aisle during the pageant. The pregnant woman watching the tv stared in awe as she favored the girl whom she's watching right now. 

*"I wonder what's her name,"* the candidate moved forward and stepped onto the platform to formally introduce herself. She was beautiful and her smile lit up her pretty face as her eyes gleamed a confident glow. 

*"Good evening, I am Allysa Kaye,"* the pregnant woman adored her name as much as she adored her beauty. 

*"Now I know what to name her."*

And on a sunny morning, a beautiful infant came into the world. 

*"Her name is Allysa Khae."*

And that's how I got my name in this life.

# My Name is Allysa, and I Started a Blog  

Honestly, I have no idea how I ended up here. Writing has always been something I wanted to do, but I never really knew how to start. Then I thought—I'm an IT student, so why not practice building static websites while setting up a blog? Before I knew it, I had a fully deployed site, all for free. It’s crazy how true it is that we can accomplish whatever we put our minds to. *[That is, God-willing.]*  

Now that I'm here, though, I’m not exactly sure where to begin. At first, this blog was just supposed to be a portfolio, something to impress future clients while I hopped from one job to another. But somewhere along the way, I realized—portfolio or not—I’m sticking with this. I’m going to make the best of it.  

I blog to express myself, to put something positive, valuable, and authentic into the world. I want this space to be as real as possible—unfiltered, unapologetic, and entirely me.
